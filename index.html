  <h1>The Boxer</h1>
  
  <h2>A Medium Short Haired Dog, Developed in 
  Germany</h2>



  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_(dog)


  <p>The Boxer is a medium to large, short-haired breed      of dog, developed in Germany. The coat is smooth and     
  tight-fitting; colors are fawn, brindled, or white, with 
  or without white markings. Boxers are brachycephalic 
  (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, 
  mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, 
  and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey. 
  The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the 
  now extinct Bullenbeisser, which became extinct by 
  crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. 
  The Boxer is a member of both The Kennel Club and 
  American Kennel Club (AKC) Working Group</p>


  <p>The first Boxer club was founded in 1895, with     
  Boxers being first exhibited in a dog show for St. 
  Bernards in Munich the next year. Based on 2013 AKC 
  statistics, Boxers held steady as the seventh-most 
  popular breed of dog in the United States for the fourth 
  consecutive year. According to the AKC's website, 
  though, the boxer is now the 11th-most popular dog breed 
  in the United States.</p>
